# Alzheimer-Prediction using ML 
# Introduction 
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking ability, and behavior. Early prediction of Alzheimer’s is crucial, as timely diagnosis can help individuals seek medical intervention and adopt treatment strategies that may slow disease progression. Machine learning offers the capability to identify subtle patterns in patient health data that may not be easily detectable by traditional diagnostic methods.

In this project, we aim to build a predictive system that classifies whether a patient is likely to have Alzheimer's disease based on lifestyle, medical history, and cognitive assessments. The objective is to evaluate several machine learning models and identify the approach that produces the most reliable predictive performance.
